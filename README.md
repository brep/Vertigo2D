Vertigo2D
=========

2D Game Engine written in C++ utilizing DirectX for rendering and Lua for scripting.


The code exhibited here is from portions of a 2D game engine I have been working on. Not all of the engine codebase is shown. 

Check out screen captured footage of a demo built utilizing the engine:

Or alternatively, play the demo yourself!

  - Make sure to read the README before running the demo on your machine! It is likely you will have to modify a configuration file (nothing major, just setting the desired resolution for the initial launch... you can also modify the resolution in the demo via the Settings menu).
