Vertigo2D
=========

2D Game Engine written in C++ utilizing DirectX for rendering, SDL2 for Audio, and Lua for scripting.


The code exhibited here is from portions of a 2D game engine I have been working on. Not all of the engine's codebase is shown. 

Check out screen captured footage of a demo built utilizing the engine:

NOTE:
  - The demo only runs on PC (for now... there are future plans to make the engine cross-platform) 
  
  - You'll need to have Microsoft Visual C++ 11 runtime installed:
